# Example Environment Variables for 𝐖𝐇𝐈𝐙-𝐌𝐃 Bot
# ===============================================
#
# Copy this file to a new file named .env in the same directory (whiz-md-bot/)
# and fill in your actual JID values below.
# Other configurations (bot name, owner name, prefixes, command list, etc.)
# can be found and modified in 'config.js'.
#
# IMPORTANT: Add the .env file to your .gitignore file to prevent committing secrets!
# Example .gitignore line:
# .env

# Optional: Port for the bot's web log viewer.
# Default is 3001 if not specified in .env or if process.env.PORT is not set (e.g., by a host like OnRender).
# BOT_WEB_PORT=3001

# JID of the owner where saved messages/statuses should also be forwarded (e.g., 2547xxxxxxxx@s.whatsapp.net)
# This is used by the 'save' on reply feature. The key name used in index.js is defined in config.js (statusSavesJidEnvKey).
OWNER_JID_FOR_STATUS_SAVES=""

# Bot Owner's JID (e.g., 2547xxxxxxxx@s.whatsapp.net)
# Used for owner-only commands like !delete, !broadcast, !restart. The key name used in index.js is defined in config.js (ownerJidEnvKey).
OWNER_JID=""

# --- Obsolete Variables ---
# WHATSAPP_SESSION_ID is NO LONGER USED for this Baileys-based bot.
# Authentication is handled by scanning a QR code in the console on first run,
# and session data is stored in the 'baileys_auth_info' directory.
